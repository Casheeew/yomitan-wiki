> While we have made some substantial changes, the majority of the extension's functionality is thanks to hard work of [FooSoft](https://foosoft.net/) and many other incredible open source contributors from 2016-2023.

## Major changes:

- 🌐 Added multi-language support!
- 💪 Completed the Manifest V2 → V3 transition, [read why here](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/resuming-the-transition-to-mv3/).
- ⚡ Switched to using ECMAScript modules and npm-sourced dependencies.
- 🔧 Implemented an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline.
- 🧪 Switched to standard testing frameworks, vitest and playwrights.

### In addition, we have made important bug fixes and minor enhancements:

- ⚡ Improved dictionary import speeds by 2x~10x.
- 📚 Added functionality to import/export multiple dictionaries, enabling portability across devices.
- ✨ And [more](https://github.com/themoeway/yomitan/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+-label%3Aarea%2Fdependencies+-label%3Akind%2Fmeta).

Since the owner requested forks be uniquely named, we have chosen a new name, _Yomitan_ (_-tan_ is an honorific used for anthropomorphic moe characters).
